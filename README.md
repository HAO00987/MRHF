Automated damage segmentation for concrete bridges is a fundamental task in infrastructure maintenance, yet existing systems often depend heavily on large annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to produce. This paper presents an innovative framework for concrete bridge damage segmentation, leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to reduce the reliance on extensive annotated data while enhancing segmentation accuracy and efficiency. Firstly, a SAM-guided mask generation network is introduced, which utilizes SAMâ€™s segmentation capabilities to generate supplementary supervision labels for damage segmentation. Then, a novel point-prompting strategy, incorporating saliency information, is proposed to refine SAM's prompts, ensuring accurate mask generation for complex damage patterns. Next, a trainable semantic segmentation network is designed, integrating MambaVision and ResNet as dual backbones to capture multi-level features from concrete bridge damages. To fuse these features effectively, a Hierarchical Attention Fusion (HAF) mechanism is introduced. Finally, a Polarized Self-Attention (PSA) decoder is employed to improve segmentation precision. Experiments on a dataset of 10,000 concrete bridge images with box-level annotations achieved state-of-the-art performance, with MIoU of 60.13\%, PA of 74.02\%, and MDice of 75.40\%, outperforming existing segmentation models. In summary, this study improves the accuracy of concrete bridge damage segmentation through a series of innovative methods and strategies, and the concrete bridge damage segmentation algorithm opens up new horizons and directions.
